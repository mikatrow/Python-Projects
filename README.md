Details
=======

This repository consists of some basic Python Projects I've tried as a beginner, by the time you are reading I may have updated with more easier/complex code.

Usage
=====

To run a file, you need to have installed [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your device, after installation > execute python run command into your console, for example if you need to run the [basic-calcultor.py](https://github.com/mikatrow/Python-Projects/blob/main/basic-calculator.py) file then enter: 
```console
python basic-calculator.py
```

Example Usage
=============
```console

```
